# AlbionOnline.itemSelling
Small python tool that eases the process of selling huge amounts of items and calculating profits. Made for the mmorpg Albion Online

## Requirements
Having python installed - Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/

## How to use
* Fill your inventory with loot.
* Open the script.
* select language (english / spanish)
* Repair the items and type in the repair cost in the script.
* Type in the market's tax (depends if you have premium or not). 
  * Note: Having to update the selling prices is common, so you'll have to pay extra silver each time you do it for each item. I recommend to type in a higher tax to compensate (+5% should be enough but it's up to you).
* Type in the amount of players if you have to split the profit due to a group activity.
* Now the big thing: entering prices. You should repeat this process until finished
  * Click sell order in-game
  * check out the price (lower it or modify it as necessary)
  * alt+tab to the script
  * enter the price, hit enter, alt tab back to the game.
  * confirm the sell order, proceed to the next item.
  * alt+tab forth and back until you're done.
  * when you're finished, type 0 and hit enter.
  * Now you should be able to see all the information about the selling, prices and profit.


**Bear in mind** that when selling, you'll see two different prices, you should type in the script the one at the bottom![selling image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74478967/116302912-21357e00-a778-11eb-89bb-81d8dcc08866.png)

A .txt file named selling.txt will be created where the script is located, in case you need to check the numbers. If you dont rename it or delete it, it will be overwritten the next time you use the script.
